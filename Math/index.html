	<h4>Why I Like Math</h4>
	  <p> I love math because I like recognizing the patterns in the world. Almost everything we see and experience in our daily lives can be explained or described with math, 
		from birds flying south in vs to the ferris wheeel in an amusement park. My favortie mathmatical patterns are the ones that can be found in nature, 
		like instances of the Golden Ratio spiral in seashells. Math comes in many styles and types, my favorite being geometry. </p>
	<h4>Geometry</h4>
	  <p> I like geometry the best because it describes so much of what we interact with in the world. Things that happen can be described through complex algebraic models, 
		but everything we actually interact in any given moment with can be put in geometric terms. One of my favorite parts of geometry is the study of platonic solids, 
		which are regular polyhedra. They consist of a set of points in a 3D area, which are connected by the same regular polygons. Any given point has the same number of polygons around it. 
		My favorite of these is the icosahedron, a polyhedron with 20 equilateral triangles as faces, 5 around each of its 12 points. </p>
	<h4>A Brief Timeline</h4>
	  <p> 
		  2016-2018 <br> 
		  I started doing math when I was in Kindergarten or first grade, just like everybody else. <br>
		  2019-2021 <br> 
		  I think I first started <i>liking</i> math when I was in 3rd or 4th grade. For me, this was during the COVID-19 pandemic, and so I got to do math from home. 
		  This meant I started being able to do math at my own pace, and work things out on my own. <br>
	  	  2021-2022 <br> 
		  This was definitely the first year I got to do more math than usual. There were a few times I got to work on more or different work, 
	  	  and this was the first year I was able to help other kids with their math. <br>
	  	  2022-2023 <br> 
		  At this point, in my school, we were split into Accelerated and On Level math. I was in Accelerated, and my 6th grade teacher 
	  	  really helped meet my needs by giving me supplemental material to learn with on occasion, through the College of Mary and William. <br>
	  	  2023-2025 <br>  
		  My seventh and eighth grade years, my math teacher really helped me nurture my interest in math by allowing me to work, more or less, at my own pace. 
	  	  I sat in the back of the classroom and would try to work out the new material for myself before the teacher taught it to the class, and this worked most of the time. 
	  	  Sometimes I still definitely needed help with a concept, but in general I was able to complete work early and sometimes did extra work online or through more advanced practice problems. 
	  	  At the end of my seventh grade year, my teacher recommended I take a summer geometry course through 
	  	  <a class="mathlink" href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqOsvnRml5FUO1xjSp6M3lJEM6KhVvitRI5XEbh3qKogh3PtwUp">Art of Problem Solving</a>, so that I could earn a highschool credit in
	  	  order to get to higher math quicker. This course was very intense, but it greatly helped me find more of my interest in math. In eight grade, I continued to work ahead, and by the end of the year,
	  	  I got to learn a topic the rest of the class did not have time for, because of that summer course. <br>
